# dataMiningOfGoogleAnalyticsData
#### Leveraging Data Mining Algorithms (in Python) to Learn Characteristics of Returning Users and Power Users.
This repository consists of my analysis of an organization's google analytics data using a machine learning approach. I have leveraged various data mining classification algorithms including SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and others to understand characteristics of the organization's returning users and power users.
